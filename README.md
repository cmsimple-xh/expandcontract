**A plugin for CMSimple_XH**

Expandcontract_XH allows to display other CMSimple_XH pages within a page. The display can be expanded (expanded) and closed again (contracted). If JavaScript is not available in the browser, the links act like normal links.

The plugin was originally developed by [Frank Ziesing (svasti)](https://svasti.de/). Since 2022 the CMSimple_XH community ([forum](https://cmsimpleforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=18315#p82951)) takes care of the further development of the plugin.
